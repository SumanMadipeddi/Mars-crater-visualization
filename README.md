Mars Crater Analysis
This project presents a visualization of the Mars Crater dataset, aimed at engaging museum visitors by effectively communicating interesting insights about craters on Mars. The visualization combines creativity with informative elements to create an exhibit that captures attention and encourages exploration.

Dataset Choice
For this project, the Mars Craters dataset was selected. This global dataset contains information on approximately 380,000 craters on Mars, allowing for a rich exploration of the planet's geological features.

Project Features
Custom Visualization: A unique D3-based graphic that moves beyond traditional visualization techniques, incorporating custom elements.
Multiple Attributes: The exhibit visualizes at least three different attributes from the dataset, providing a comprehensive overview.
Interactive Exhibit: Designed to engage visitors through interactive elements, allowing them to explore the data in an intuitive manner.

Visualization Overview
Design Elements
Title: The exhibit features a clear, engaging title at the top of the visualization.
Description: Below the visualization, a brief explanation details the design choices, including marks, channels, and interactions used throughout the project.
Custom Shapes: The visualization employs custom shapes to represent different crater attributes, enhancing visual appeal and comprehension.

Attributes Visualized
Crater Diameter: The size of each crater is represented through varying circle sizes, allowing users to easily gauge relative dimensions.
Depth: Color gradients indicate crater depth, providing a visual cue for geological analysis.
Location: A spatial distribution of craters is shown using a map overlay, highlighting their geographical context on Mars.

Visualization Type
This project falls under the "modded" custom visualization category. It builds upon existing D3.js techniques but has been significantly altered to create a distinct representation of the Mars crater data. The modifications include:

1. Heat Map for Density: Integrated a heat map to visually represent the density of craters, allowing visitors to quickly identify regions with significant crater activity.
2. Custom Shape Integration: Developed unique shapes for each crater, enhancing the visual representation based on size and depth.
3. Interactive Features: Implemented hover effects to provide detailed crater information, such as diameter and depth, when users interact with individual craters.
4. Geographical Context: Adapted the layout to include a map of Mars, giving spatial context to the crater data.
5. Lollipop Representation: Used lollipop charts to illustrate the depth of craters, where the lollipop's height corresponds to the depth value, adding a playful yet informative touch to the visualization.
